# Burp Suite Pentesting

A personal exploration into web vulnerability testing using **Burp Suite** against OWASP’s intentionally vulnerable Juice Shop web application. This project showcases experimentation with HTTP interception, request tampering, and various attack simulations, all aimed at learning core web security concepts.

## Note

This was a hands-on practice project to better understand common web vulnerabilities and the use of Burp Suite’s key features. It is not intended for production or offensive security without permission.

## Features

* **Local Juice Shop Setup with Docker**: Deployed a local instance of OWASP Juice Shop for safe vulnerability testing.
* **HTTP Interception and Request Tampering**: Used **Repeater** and **Intercept** tools to manipulate HTTP requests and responses.
* **SQL Injection Simulation**: Demonstrated SQLi on login fields to bypass authentication.
* **User Enumeration**: Identified sensitive user data via HTTP responses.
* **Open Directory Discovery**: Detected exposed directories via HTTP History panel.
* **Basket ID Exploitation**: Performed **IDOR** (Insecure Direct Object Reference) attacks via basket enumeration.
* **JWT Token Decoding**: Explored token decryption using the **Decoder** tool.
* **Negative Quantity Logic Flaws**: Simulated logic flaws using crafted requests.

## Stack

* **Burp Suite (Community Edition)**
* **Kali Linux**
* **OWASP Juice Shop (via Docker)**
* **Chromium Browser**
